     /*1*/"Right after move out of the exit, you stumble upon a SLIME!! WTH, THERE'S A SLIME IN HERE??? Luckily, there's branch under your foot, you pick it up and hold it in your hand.",
     /*2*/"The slime is dead! Yuck! Its goo still sticks to your hands. Anyways, you continue moving on until a fork road appeared ahead. Left one is blurry black while the right one is narrow as hell!",
     /*3*/"You decide to go throw the left hallway. The hallway fills with eerie atmosphere and darkness everywhere. Suddenly, ANOTHER SLIME IS COMING TOWARD YOU!! THIS SLIME IS EVEN SPARKLING WITH GEM! WTH. Time to show it who's the boss here with ya branch!",
     /*4*/"You decide to go throw the right hallway. Ugh, this hallway is so thin that feel like it gonna crush you in a matter of time. You have no choice but continue forward...",
     /*5*/"Victory is yours, haha! Those slime will never pass through your mighty strength! You stumble upon a room behind the slime. It's appear a weaponry room. There's a sword and a dagger lie around a wooden table. You can only grab one since you have no place to carry another.",
     /*6*/"While walking, there's an axe hanging on the side wall! How fortunately, you take an axe with you and throw the branch away. Few more extra steps, A WILD SLIME APPEAR! A SLIME WITH FURRR?? AWMYGODD. No more thinking, time to use our brand new axe to chop this slime into half."
